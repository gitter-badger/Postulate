# Postulate ORM

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/i8uoaftti334xuth/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/adamosoftware/postulate/branch/master)

[1/16/19] I figured out I need to target .NET Standard to achieve the most compatibility. I just now got this implemented in this repo and Nuget packages version 1.3.1 uploaded:

- Postulate.SqlServer
- Postulate.MySql

[12/14/18] I'm updating my existing [Postulate.Lite](https://github.com/adamosoftware/Postulate.Lite) library to target .NET Core as well as several .NET Framework versions. I'm also dropping the "Lite" part of the name.

Nuget packages are:
- Postulate.SqlServer
- Postulate.MySql
